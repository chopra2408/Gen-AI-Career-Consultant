        ### JOB POSTING DETAILS:
        Role: {job_role}
        Skills Required: {job_skills}
        Job Description: {job_desc_text}

        ### RESUME CONTENT:
        {resume_text}

        ### PORTFOLIO SKILLS (CSV):
        {candidate_portfolio_skills}

        ### INSTRUCTION:
        1. Analyze the candidateâ€™s resume content AND portfolio skills together against the job posting.
        2. Synthesize information from BOTH sources (resume and portfolio) to assess skills, experience, and project work.
        3. Compare the combined candidate profile with the required job skills and description.
        4. Calculate the overall percentage of required skills matched, considering evidence from both resume and portfolio. Provide the calculation or reasoning if possible.
        5. Based on the combined analysis:
           - If the overall match is 80% or higher: Set Suitability to "Yes". Generate *at least* 5 relevant technical interview questions with concise answers, drawing from job requirements and skills/experiences evident in BOTH resume and portfolio. Generate *at least* 2 behavioral questions related to projects or experiences mentioned in EITHER the resume or portfolio. List the matched skills (from both sources) and the calculated percentage.
           - If the overall match is less than 80%: Set Suitability to "No". Provide detailed reasons for unsuitability, identifying specific skill/experience gaps considering both resume and portfolio. Offer 3-4 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement tailored to bridge the gap towards the job requirements, potentially suggesting how to better showcase existing skills. List the matched skills (from both sources) and the calculated percentage.
        6. Structure the entire output as a single, valid JSON object with keys like "Suitability", "Skill Match Percentage", "Matched Skills", "Interview Questions" (list of objects with "Question" and "Answer"), "Behavioral Questions" (list of strings), "Reasons for Unsuitability" (list of strings), "Suggestions" (list of strings). Only include keys relevant to the suitability outcome.
        7. Ensure the JSON is valid and contains no preamble or commentary outside the JSON structure.

How have you used them together for data analysis?", "Answer": "Likely used Pandas within Python scripts to load, clean (e.g., handle missing values, transform data types), analyze (e.g., group by, aggregate), and potentially visualize data."}},
             {{"Question": "The job requires API development, and it's listed in your portfolio. Can you describe an API you built or consumed?", "Answer": "Candidate should describe a specific project, mentioning the framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Node/Express) or method (e.g., REST principles, specific endpoints) used."}},
             {{"Question": "Explain how you would version control your code using Git, as mentioned on your resume.", "Answer": "Using commands like git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git branch, git merge. Emphasize commit frequency and meaningful messages."}},
             {{"Question": "Write a SQL query to find users who have placed more than 5 orders.", "Answer": "SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(OrderID) FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 5;"}},
             {{"Question": "What data visualization libraries (mentioned in portfolio) have you used and for what purpose?", "Answer": "Candidate should name libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) and describe creating charts (e.g., bar, line, scatter) to communicate insights."}}
          ],
          "Behavioral Questions": [
            "Tell me about the 'Data Cleaning Project' listed in your portfolio. What was the most challenging aspect?",
